The archive contains experimental data of sampling and spoofing tasks for Google's Sycamore circuits
==========

1. circuits/ 
   - Sycamore RQCs in .qsim format used for simulation;
2. sampling/
   - 5 text files with samples from Sycamore circuits with 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 cycles;
   - 2 text files with the amplitudes of the produced samples for 12 and 14 cycles;
3. spoofing/ 
   - file with 3M bitstrings produced from one big batch of 32M bitstrings simulated with fidelity 0.47%, 
   where for each bitstring we also provide the exact amplitudes calculated with 100% fidelity.
